This is a work day planner that provides the user with the current date as well as 
columns that represent each hour of the work day. Users can schedule and save information
for each hour. The past, present, and future time is highlighted with assigned colors to 
make the user aware of time! Information added by the user is saved in local storage and
will remain, regardless if the page is refreshed.
